## Weather Station with ESP32

The sensor system is built on an **ESP32** and collects real-time data from various environmental sensors. The ESP32 is connected to the internet to transmit the data to the **Chacka360** platform.

### Integrated Sensors:
- **GPS**: Accurate location of the drone and its readings.
- **Atmospheric Pressure**: Measured in millibars (mb).
- **Altitude**: Measured in meters above sea level (masl).
- **Humidity**: Expressed as a percentage (%).
- **Temperature**: Expressed in degrees Celsius (Â°C).
- **Air Quality**: Measured in parts per million (PPM).

## Instructions to Run the Arduino Code:
1. **Install the Required Libraries:**
   - Install the following libraries in your Arduino IDE:
     - `TinyGPS++`
     - `Adafruit_Sensor`
     - `Adafruit_BME280_Library`
     - `ESP32WiFi`
   
2. **Upload the Code:**
   - Connect your ESP32 to your computer.
   - Open the Arduino IDE and paste your code.
   - Select the correct board (`ESP32 Dev Module`) and port.
   - Click on the upload button to upload the code to the ESP32.

3. **Monitor the Serial Output:**
   - Open the Serial Monitor in the Arduino IDE to view the data being transmitted to the **Chacka360** platform.
