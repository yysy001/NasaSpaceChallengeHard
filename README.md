## Weather Station with ESP32

The sensor system is built on an **ESP32** and collects real-time data from various environmental sensors. The ESP32 is connected to the internet to transmit the data to the **Chacka360** platform.

### Integrated Sensors:
- **GPS**: Accurate location of the drone and its readings.
- **Atmospheric Pressure**: Measured in millibars (mb).
- **Altitude**: Measured in meters above sea level (masl).
- **Humidity**: Expressed as a percentage (%).
- **Temperature**: Expressed in degrees Celsius (Â°C).
- **Air Quality**: Measured in parts per million (PPM).

## 2. Parrot Bebop 2 Drone

The Parrot Bebop 2 is a versatile development drone equipped for advanced agricultural applications. It operates seamlessly with the Robot Operating System (ROS), allowing for robust control and data management.

The drone communicates with a Flutter application using socket I/O, enabling real-time telemetry and data visualization. This integration facilitates efficient monitoring and control of drone operations, enhancing decision-making for agricultural tasks.
